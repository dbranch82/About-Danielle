	<body><p>I am a famous chef, restaurateur, author of cookery books, and media personality. My speciality is Italian
			cuisine. My Fans and followers throughout the world have re-discovered the joy of cooking through my many fresh
			and delicious dishes and my countless books. I have also appeared on a number of food and cooking-related
			reality shows, where I was called for my expertise and guidance or as a judge. Although I started my career
			as a pastry chef, I now own and co-own several leading restaurants, related enterprises and non-profit
			organizations throughout the world.
